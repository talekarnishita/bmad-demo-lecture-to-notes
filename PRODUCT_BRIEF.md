# Product Brief: Dev Demo

## Problem

Students attend lectures but struggle to turn recordings into useful study materials. They end up with:
- Long, unstructured transcripts they don't revisit
- No clear way to extract key concepts
- Time wasted rewatching full lectures before exams

**Impact:** Students re-learn instead of review, leading to cramming, poor retention, and lower confidence.

## User

**Primary:** University students in technical subjects (e.g., Computer Science, Engineering) who:
- Attend dense, fast-paced lectures
- Have access to lecture recordings
- Need to review efficiently before exams

**Journey:** Upload lecture → get structured notes → review in minutes instead of rewatching hours.

## Goal

Validate that **structured notes** (sections, summary, key concepts) help students review lecture material efficiently. This demo tests output quality before building the full product.

## Success

**Demo succeeds if:**
- Students can review a 60–90 minute lecture in 5–10 minutes using the structured output
- Output quality is high enough that concepts feel clearer
- Users want to use it again (not just a one-time test)

**What we're validating:** Can AI turn a raw transcript into structured, reviewable notes that save time?

## Non-Goals (Demo Scope)

- User accounts or persistence
- Production infrastructure
- Cross-lecture linking or advanced features
- Authentication or security beyond basic demo needs

**Why:** Focus on output quality first. If structured notes work, then build the full platform.
